# Useful Dependents

search useful dependents for GitHub project.

Every time I look at a new open source project to learn, in addition to reading the documentation, I also want to see how other projects that use this project for development are being used. However, GitHub's dependents always has to flip through many pages to find a suitable project. So I wrote a tool to help me find the corresponding dependents projects. May it help you too. 

Even tiny pull requests are greatly appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è.
